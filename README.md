# Microsoft and Github workers declare support for China's 996.ICU movement

Chinese tech workers are using Github to bring attention to the illegal labor practices at many companies in the Chinese tech industry. The Github project is titled [996.ICU](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU). 996 represents the working hours of many tech companies in China - from 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week. "By following the '996' work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit)," says the 996.icu Github project description. The project calls for Chinese tech companies to obey the labor laws in China and the international labor convention. 

This initiative has garnered massave support within China. Chinese tech workers have been starring the Github repository as a way of showing their support. In the span of a few weeks, the project has been starred over 200,000 times making it one of the fastest growing Github projects in the service's history.

Github is the ideal place for the 996.ICU movement. The platform, owned by Microsoft, is a haven for developers to save, share, and collaborate on software projects. It offers features similar to that of a social network. Developers can save or bookmark other people's projects, and engage in discussion through Github issues. 

Most important for the 996.ICU movement is that Github is accessible in China. It is the dominant platform for developers to collaborate and is a crucial part of Chinese tech companies' daily operations. Since going viral, Chinese domestic browsers, such as those by Tencent and Alibaba, have restricted access to the 996.ICU repository on Github, warning users that the repository contains illegal or malicious content. While it is still unknown as to whether these companies are blocking the repository on their own accord, we must entertain the possibility that Microsoft and Github will be pressured to remove the repository as well. 

In response to these events, we, the workers of Microsoft and Github, support of the 996.ICU movement and stand in solidarity with tech workers in China. In doing so, we encourage Microsoft, a company that firmly believes in a healthy work-life balance, to under no circumstances, remove the repository from Github. To the best of its ability, we will continue to support the 996.ICU movement, and its ability to effectively use Github as a platform to spread the voices and stories of Chinese tech workers.
