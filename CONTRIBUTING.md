## Translation

Microsoft and Github are global companies with workers all around the world. While English and Chinese are the primary languages we support, we welcome translations of the letter into other languages. To do so, make a pull-request with your translated version of the letter under `README_<language_cod>.md`. For example, the spanish translation may look like `README_ES.md`.

When creating the pull-request for a language translation, please add a native speaker to review the contents of the pull-request.
